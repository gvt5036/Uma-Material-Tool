INSTALLATION:

1. Download "Uma Material Tool.py".
2. In Blender, navigate to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons.
3. Select the Dropdown arrow in the top right.
4. Choose Install from Disk
5. Select "Uma Material Tool.py"

REQUIRED SETUP:

1. Download Looper Honstropy's Umamusume Materials here: https://github.com/LooperHonstropy/BLENDER-Uma-Musume-Pretty-Derby-Shaders
2. In your Blender project with your Umamusume model imported, append "Icosphere of Materials" collection from the .blend file provided.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. In object mode, select your mesh. Should be named something like "XXXX_Uma Name_Mesh"
2. On the sidebar, select Uma Tool with the mesh still selected.
3. Click "Apply and Rename Materials"
4. If it's your first time it will require you to input your texture directory. Should be named "Texture2D" and will be wherever your models are located.
5. Input your Uma's Number. This is the "XXXX" in the object name.
6. Input your Uma's name. This can be whatever you want. This only affects the name of your materials for the sake of organization.
7. Hit OK and watch your materials apply!

LIMITATIONS

Currently this only works for an Uma's signature racewear. I plan to update this in the future.
Some textures may or may not be working in this version as I continue to tweak the script.
